These tasks were solved using Bash and APL (because I was learning both ðŸ˜€).
Bash is used for pre-processing input file and copying to clipboard, then pasting and using in APL code.
I know it is possible to read files in APL also - but I was using [Try APL](tryapl.org) - it doesn't allow file I/O.
