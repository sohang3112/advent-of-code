# advent-of-code
My solutions to Advent of Code using Bash and APL (because I'm learning both ðŸ˜€).
I'm using Bash for pre-processing input file and copying to clipboard, then pasting and using in APL code.
I know it is possible to read file in APL also - but I don't know how (and also because I'm currently using 
[Try APL](tryapl.org) - I don't think it will allow file I/O).
